1. Foundations/BigInt (Python):
    ~~a. Implementing a more efficient digits array, potentially using fixed-length integer bit mapping.  ~~Implemented in Java

2. Foundations/BigInt(Java):
    ~~a. Implement basic arithmetics for BigInt.~~ Right now, addition, subtraction and multiplication have been implemented. Division should probably be postponed after the implementation of BigDecimal
    b. Implement division based on BigDecimal

3. LinkedList/DoublyLinkedList(C++):
    ~~a. Implement basic operations of a Doubly Linked List~~
    b. Add more comprehensive tests
    c. Add support for iterators

4. UniquePointer(C++):
    ~~a. Implemented a basic smartpointer with unique ownership.~~
