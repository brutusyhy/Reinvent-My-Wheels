# Reinvent-My-Wheels
A personal study project where I tried to implement classical DSA and solve common problems in different languages.

# Languages Used
For now, I am planning to write code in the following languages that I find most interesting/relevant for my work:
C++, C#, Rust, Java, TypeScript, Python

# Strategy
I decided to adopt a hybrid strategy between reinvention and learnining from best practices: I will always write the first implementation on my own without consulting any existing implementations; after that, I will iteratively refine my solutions by comparing them with existing ones (such as C++ STL and Java Collections). When writing in different languages, I will seek to learn and adopt language-specific idioms rather than simply translating the same code into different languages.
